# Simple shelter management

A dummy project, for the purposes of developing and demoing [Larry](https://github.com/JasonHorsleyTech/Larry), the laravel virtual assistant.

## Setup
You need GPT_ENABLED=true and a key (.env.example)

You need auth()->user() and middleware('auth');

You need to get queues up and running

## Notes
Need to pull out logic from Converse.vue. Nova has JS in composer package, why not just "require vue" and keep it all together?
